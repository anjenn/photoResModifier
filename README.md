# About the project
This project is an extended version of a lab exercise on k-means clustering from the course
'Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning' offered by Deeplearning.AI.

# What I did
To reinforce my understanding, I implemented the code in my own environment
and further explored the algorithm by experimenting with custom images,
varying values of k (the number of clusters), and iteration sizes.
Additionally, I tested the impact of applying color filters before computing the centroids
to observe how pre-processing influences the clustering results.
